# Panoptic-DeepLab (CVPR 2020)

Panoptic-DeepLab is a state-of-the-art bottom-up method for panoptic segmentation, 
where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to 
every pixel in the input image as well as instance labels (e.g. an id of 1, 2, 3, 
etc) to pixels belonging to thing classes.

This is the **PyTorch re-implementation** of our CVPR2020 paper: 
[Panoptic-DeepLab: A Simple, Strong, and Fast Baseline for Bottom-Up Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10194).

## Disclaimer
* This is a **re-implementation** of Panoptic-DeepLab, it is not guaranteed to reproduce all numbers in the paper, please refer to the
original numbers from [Panoptic-DeepLab: A Simple, Strong, and Fast Baseline for Bottom-Up Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10194)
when making comparison.

## What's New
* We release a detailed [technical report](/docs/tech_report.pdf) with implementation details 
and supplementary analysis on Panoptic-DeepLab. In particular, we find center prediction is almost perfect and the bottleneck of 
bottom-up method still lies in semantic segmentation
* It is powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep learning framework.
* Can be trained even on 4 1080TI GPUs (no need for 32 TPUs!).
